	"subtitle": "Tet, also known as the Vietnamese Lunar New Year, is the biggest and most important event for every Vietnamese citizen, along with all the international students who are away from home like us. Once a year, VAS, together with all of the volunteers, plan and prepare thoroughly to organize the New Year event, with the hope of bringing spiritual joys to the students. In previous years, VAS held this event directly in the SSF's stage area, however, in 2021, because of the prolonged epidemic, the organizers held a Tet event with the theme \"Cause you are not alone on Tet!\" lasted for nearly three hours via online supporting tool, ZOOM Meeting. However, with all the enthusiasm and effort, the program took place extremely meaningful with the participation of nearly 100 students!"
